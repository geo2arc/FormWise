## üîß Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/formwise_ai.git
    cd formwise_ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

To start the development server and build the extension for testing:

1.  **Build the extension in watch mode:**
    This command will watch for file changes and rebuild the extension automatically.
    ```bash
    bun build --watch
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory containing the unpacked extension files.

2.  **Load the extension in Chrome:**
    -   Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    -   Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner.
    -   Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
    -   Select the `dist` directory from the project folder.

The FormWise AI extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically rebuilt, and you can reload the extension from the `chrome://extensions` page to see the updates.

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the extension, run:

```bash
bun build
```

This will generate the final production-ready files in the `dist` directory, which you can then package into a `.zip` file for submission to the Chrome Web Store.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

While the core of this project is a Chrome Extension, it may include a Cloudflare Worker for backend functionalities in later phases.

To deploy the worker component to Cloudflare:

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    ```bash
    bun wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the worker:**
    ```bash
    bun deploy
    ```

This command will build and deploy the worker defined in `worker/index.ts` to your Cloudflare account.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The extension is built with a modern Chrome Extension architecture:

-   **Popup:** A React UI for quick interactions, allowing users to select profiles and trigger form filling.
-   **Options Page:** A full-page React application for comprehensive profile and settings management (CRUD).
-   **Content Script:** A script injected into web pages to interact with forms (reading and writing data).
-   **Background Service Worker:** A central script that manages state, handles events, and orchestrates communication between different parts of the extension.

All user data is persisted in `chrome.storage.local`, ensuring it remains secure and private on the user's device.
